Dart is similar to python3
* Everything can you place in a variable is an object, and every object is an
  instance of class. Even numbers, functions, and null are objects.
* comes with generic types -- python lint

## Build in types

* numbers --> num, int, double
* Strings 
* Booleans --> true or false
* Lists --> [0, ...list] or [0, ...?list] might be null
* Sets 
* Maps
